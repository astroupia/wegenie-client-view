# Wegenie Fundraising Platform

Wegenie is a modern, full-featured fundraising platform designed to connect donors with causes. Our platform allows users to explore campaigns, donate to causes, and track the impact of their contributions. This system is built using a scalable architecture, either as a monolithic application or with a decoupled frontend and backend.

## Architecture Overview

**Monolithic Approach:**
- Integrated frontend and API using Next.js.
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for improved performance and SEO.
- PostgreSQL for data persistence.

**Microservices Approach:**
- Decoupled Next.js frontend.
- Express.js backend handling business logic and data management.
- RESTful API for frontend-backend communication.
- PostgreSQL/MySQL for the database, with Redis for caching.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- PostgreSQL or MySQL (For database)
- Git (For version control)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/wegenie-platform.git
cd wegenie-platform

cd wegenie-next-frontend
npm install
# Make sure to update the .env file to point to the correct backend API
npm run dev


### Notes on Usage

- Modify the URLs and paths according to your actual repository and environment settings.
- This README template assumes that you have licensing and contribution guidelines ready. If not, those sections should be appropriately updated or expanded.
- Ensure that any local development instructions are clear and that environment variables are documented but not exposed.
- You may want to add a section detailing how to run tests if your project includes automated tests.
